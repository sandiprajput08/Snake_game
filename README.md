Preview locally
----------------
Quick preview with Python's simple HTTP server (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\all projects\pygame"
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser
```

Or just open `index.html` directly in your browser (recommended to use the HTTP server for consistent behavior).
